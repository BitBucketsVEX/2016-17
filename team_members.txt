This file serves as a tutorial on basic Git workflow. It allows people to practice a 
workflow without harming anything more important than this file.

Git will allow sets of files to be considered as a complete configuration for easier
identification of state; this differs from things like google drive, which allow recovery
of individual file histories, but requires much effort to recover a state for a group of
files.

Following the instructions below, your task is to branch or fork the repository containing
this file and add your name to this file in alphabetical order by last name along with an 
alias and a date. Each new member of the team will do this and commit the file back for
merging with the master branch.

Only collaborators and the repository owner can modify the master branch (sometimes called
a trunk). The master branch is always considered a deployable product, so it is bad form
to edit and commit changes directly to the master branch.

Instead users should (almost) always create a branch or fork.

If you own a repository (or are listed as a collaborator) you can create branch, work in
it, and commit changes without messing up the master branch. When you are satisfied that
the changes are ready for review and incorporation into the master branch you will
create a pull request (asking the collaborators to consider the update and merge it into
the master branch.

If you are not a collaborator, you will create a fork (look in the upper right corner of
the web view of the repository) and make you changes from the fork. Notice that a fork
also has a master branch and you can consider your workflow from there as well.
